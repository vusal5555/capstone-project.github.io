# capstone-project.github.io
This is my first ever react project I am currenly working on for learning purposes. it is an e-commerce page which allows users to pick an item they would like to purchase, bookmark it and order.
The project allows me to deep dive into the concepts of React, implement them in real-world scenarious and see the results, which boosts my confindence while learning to code as well as consolides what I have learned so far.
If you are intersted in my works or have any questions feel free to reach out to me on Github and Facebook/Vusal Novruzov https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008365504090.
